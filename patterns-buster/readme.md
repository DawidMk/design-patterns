*REQUIREMENTS*

* Groovy

*BEFORE*
Clone this repository and run the AppTest to see if code works ok.
For every pattern there is a test written in the Groovy Spock with @PendingFeature annotation -> take a look here:
http://spockframework.org/spock/javadoc/1.1-SNAPSHOT/spock/lang/PendingFeature.html

If you change your code correctly, it means that you implement the feature and you will have to
remove the @PendingFeature annotation from existing test.
